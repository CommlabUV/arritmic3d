# Arritmic3D
A fast Eikonal computational model for electrophysiology simulation (Ventricle version).

The simulator has two versions in separate branches: branch `ventricle`, with the ventricle version, and branch `atria`, with the atria version. Checkout the desired branch before proceeding.

## Installation
* Install Processing (https://processing.org/) (at least, version 3.4)
* Run processing and install the required libraries. To do so, open the _Tools_ menu, select _Manage tools_ and, there, go to _Libraries_ tab.
    * Install `PeasyCam` and `ControlP5`.
    * Instal the `Toxi` library, following these steps:
        1.	Download `
    toxiclibs-complete-0021.zip` from: https://github.com/postspectacular/toxiclibs/releases.
        2.	Open Processing.
        3.	Go to File->Preferences.
        4.	Check the value of the field labeled "Sketchbook location:" and open this path in a file browser.
        6.	Inside that folder you should find another folder called "libraries". Extract the toxiclib library downloaded in STEP 1 and copy it into this location.
        7.	Restart Processing.
* Clone or download this repository and open the file `arrithmic3D/arritmic3D.pde` from within Processing. Note that Processing requires the directory and the file have the same name.


## Preparing a case
To run a case, you will need several subdirectories inside `arritmic3D`.
* Two directories called `RestitutionCurves` and `RestitutionSurfaces`.
* A directory called `casos` with a case per subdirectory in it.

You can download sample data from Zenodo [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14277909.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14277909).
Optionally, you can build your own case from a VTK file using the scripts in the `Readers/` directory (no documentation for this yet, sorry...). Block cases (rectangular slabs of tissue) can also be built.



### Restitution curves directory
This directory contains the parameters of the restituion curve activation models.
* `restitutionCurves` directory. Inside this folder are files in the format `RestitutionCurve_A_B_C.csv` where A={BZ, Sanas} (respectively: Border Zone, Helthy); B={APD, CV} and C={Endo, Epi, Mid}


### Cases directory
A directory called `casos/` is necessary. There, each case will be hosted inside a subdirectory, containing the geometric and biophysical information for the case. You can download the Krueger et al. (2013) simulation case from the URL indicated above.
Inside each case directory the files required are:

* `Endo.stl`
* params.dat (The parameters to be entered in this file are described below)
* A folder `Reader_VTK` that contains:
    * `cell_conex_nodos.txt` : M x N matrix describing for each of the M elements the N nodes that make it up
    * `centerMass-BLP.txt` : 3 x 1 vector describing the (x, y, z)â€™ coordinate of the center of mass of the atria
    * `centroidCellX.txt` : R x 1 vector describing for each of the R nodes of the geometry its x-coordinate
    * `centroidCellY.txt` : R x 1 vector describing for each of the R nodes of the geometry its y-coordinate
    * `centroidCellZ.txt` : R x 1 vector describing for each of the R nodes of the geometry its z-coordinate
    * `EndoToEpi.txt` : R x 1 vector describing for each of the R nodes the Endo (0) or Epi (1) belonging
    * `fibreOrientationX.txt` : R x 1 vector describing for each of the R nodes of the geometry its fibre orientation vector x-component
    * `fibreOrientationY.txt` : R x 1 vector describing for each of the R nodes of the geometry its fibre orientation vector y-component
    * `fibreOrientationZ.txt` : R x 1 vector describing for each of the R nodes of the geometry its fibre orientation vector z-component
    * `nodes_CasoBloqueVent.txt` : S x 1 vector containing the nodes IDs activated for the re-entrance case (! nodes counting starts from 0)
    * `pacing_34.txt` : NOT USED but must be present in the folder (it was prepared for the Ventricle case)
    * `scalarValues.txt` : NOT USED but must be present in the folder (it was prepared for the Ventricle case)
    * `scarTissue`.txt` : NOT USED but must be present in the folder (it was prepared for the Ventricle case)
    * `vecinos.txt` : R x P matrix describing for each of the R nodes of the geometry its P neighbors
    * `vertex_DlongDtransratio.txt` : R x 1 vector describing for each of the R nodes of the geometry its CV tissue-specific (CVL/CVL,LA)  factor
    * `vertex_reductCV.txt` : R x 1 vector describing for each of the R nodes of the geometry CV transversal-to-longitudinal (CVL/CVT) factor

## Usage

### Defining the simulation parameters
Open `paramsInit.dat` file located in `arritmic3D/arritmic3D` with an editor, and modify the number case option and the case folder name  you want to simulate:
````
case           :  1                         ### Case options: VENTRICLE -> 0 / BLOCK_VTK -> 1
folderCase     :  Bloque_vtk_Z06_100x200    ### FolderCase: The case folder name located in arritmic3D/arritmic3D/casos
````
Next, open `params.dat` file located in `arritmic3D/arritmic3D/casos/<folderCase>` with an editor, and modify the case parameters as you need. The definition of each parameter is detailed below in the comments:

### Running simulation
* Open `Arritmic3D.pde` file in Processing.
* Press the Run button to start the simulation
* The application has different functionalities that are activated by pressing some keys while the 'arritmic3D' display window is active:
    * 'f' key: Simulation visualization on/off
    * 'w' key: Mesh polydata visualization on/off
    * 'Arrow left / right' key: Rotate viewpoint
    * 'm' key: Visualization modes. (Life Time (default), APD, Diastolic interval, Conduction velocity, Wave front active-inactive, Activation period map)
    * 't' key: Visualize type of node by its conductivities (healthy, border zone, healthy+border zone)
    * 'i' key: Enable display of inactive nodes on/off (By default, only active nodes are displayed)
    * 'l' key: Number of active nodes
    * 'g' key: Record sequence of simulation images to build video start/stop ('f' key must be on). Files saved in arritmic3D/arritmic3D/video/videoFrames**
    * 'c' key: Generate Ensight files to save Life time animation start/stop. Saved in folder arritmic3D/arritmic3D/casos/<folderCase>/Case_***
    * 'e' key: Activate saving only the values â€‹â€‹of BZ nodes in the Lifetime Ensight recording, setting the value of healthy nodes to -2, so that they can be deleted later with threshold
    * 'x' key: Generate Ensight files to save Activation maps on each new stimulus start/stop. Saved in folder arritmic3D/arritmic3D/casos/<folderCase>/A_Map_***
    * 'y' key: Activate saving only the values â€‹â€‹of Mid nodes in the Activation maps Ensight recording, setting the value of the remaining nodes to -2, so that they can be deleted later with threshold
    * 'z' key: Activate saving only the values â€‹â€‹of BZ nodes in the Activation maps Ensight recording, setting the value of healthy nodes to -2, so that they can be deleted later with threshold

### Troubleshooting

If there is an error after pressing the Run button to start the simulation, it can be related to the frame rate definition. You can try by changing the line

<code>frameRate(caseParams.fps);</code>

by

<code>frameRate(1000);</code> (or whatever the maximum frame rate you want to be)

in the last line of the <code>setup()</code> function.
